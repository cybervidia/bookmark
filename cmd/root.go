You can add bookmarks by name and URL, list all saved bookmarks,
retrieve a bookmark URL to the clipboard, or delete bookmarks by name.

Usage examples:
  bookmark add <name> <url>           Add a bookmark with the given name and URL
  bookmark add -c <name>               Add a bookmark using the URL from the clipboard
  bookmark list                       Display all saved bookmarks
  bookmark get <name>                 Copy the URL of the named bookmark to the clipboard
  bookmark delete <name>              Remove the named bookmark
